## ✨ Core Features

### Text and Translation Pipeline

- **🔍 Smart Text Detection**: automatically detects text regions in manga pages
- **📝 Multilingual OCR**: supports Japanese, Chinese, English, Korean, and more
- **🌐 Multiple Translators**: supports `OpenAI`, `Google Gemini`, `Sakura`, `OpenAI High Quality`, and `Gemini High Quality`
- **🎯 High-Quality Translation**: multimodal translators can use image context for better results
- **📚 Auto Extract Glossary**: automatically collects names, places, organizations, and other terms
- **🎨 Inpainting**: removes source text and repairs the background
- **✍️ Smart Typesetting**: renders translated text with configurable style and layout
- **🤖 AI Line Breaking**: improves readability for supported translators
- **📦 Batch Processing**: processes entire folders in one run
- **📥 PSD Export**: exports layered PSD files with original image, inpainted image, and text layers

## 🎨 Visual Editor

The built-in editor is designed for precise post-processing.

### Region Editing

- **Move**: drag a text region anywhere
- **Rotate**: rotate with the handle
- **Reshape**: adjust corners, edges, and freeform geometry
- **Create new regions**: add or paste new regions when needed
- **Edit Shape**: refine the region box shape directly in the editor

> **💡 OCR best practice**: if you want stable OCR results in the editor, try to keep one text line per region whenever possible.

### Text Editing

- **Manual translation edits**: edit the translated text directly
- **Style adjustments**: `Font`, `Font Size`, `Font Color`, `Stroke Color`, `Alignment`, and more
- **Direction control**: horizontal or vertical text

### Mask Editing

- **Brush**: paint the erase mask manually
- **Eraser**: remove incorrect mask regions
- **Mask refinement**: improve cleanup when automatic masks are not ideal

### Advanced Editing Features

- **Undo / Redo**: full history support
- **Multi-selection**: copy, paste, and delete region groups
- **Live preview**: preview render results inside the editor

## 🖥️ User Interface

- **Modern Qt UI**: built on PyQt6
- **Drag-and-drop support**: drop files or folders directly into the file list
- **Live logs**: see progress and runtime errors as tasks run
- **Config management**: import, export, and reuse configuration presets
- **Prompt Management**: manage prompt files and use `Apply Selected Prompt`
- **Font Management**: import fonts, preview them, and use `Apply Selected Font`
